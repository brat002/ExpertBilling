# This file defines the order in which the plugin files must be loaded.
# It is used by the Ext MVC's ruby plugin builder, which which can be invoked from your application's base directory like this:

#   ruby script/plugin build Printer

# This will generate a file named Printer-all.js in this directory, which is just a concatenation of all the files you list here
# NOTE: This is only used by the plugin builder, not the app itself. You must always ensure that your plugin is compiled to
# Printer-all.js by some other means if you do not use the plugin builder, as it is that file that will be loaded by your app
