Overview
========

Ext.ux.Printer is a small library that provides a generic way of printing Ext Components (Grids, Trees, etc).
It consists of the main Printer class, and a number of Renderers, which each provide support for a given type of component.

Installation
============

Printer.js and renderers/Base.js are required:

<script type="text/javascript" src="Printer.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="renderers/Base.js"></script>

The library currently comes with renderers for Ext.grid.GridPanel, and Ext.tree.ColumnTree. These can be included as required:
<script type="text/javascript" src="renderers/GridPanel.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="renderers/ColumnTree.js"></script>

Usage
=====

Ext.ux.Printer.print just take a single argument - a normal component instance. Use it like this:

var myGrid = new Ext.grid.GridPanel({
  //your usual grid config here
});

var myTree = new Ext.tree.ColumnTree({
  //your usual tree config here
})

Ext.ux.Printer.print(myGrid);
Ext.ux.Printer.print(myTree);

Each of the above examines the component you pass to the print function, and if a suitable renderer has been created
for it, the component is printed by opening a new window, writing some print-friendly HTML to it, and calling the 
window's print function.

Currently supported components are:

Ext.grid.GridPanel
Ext.tree.ColumnTreePanel

To add support for another Component type, simply subclass Ext.ux.Printer.BaseRenderer (see the existing renderers for examples),
and register it with Ext.ux.Printer.registerRenderer('somextype', Ext.ux.Printer.SomeComponentRenderer).
